💻 Exercises - Day 3
* Declare your age as integer variable
age = 25
* Declare your height as a float variable
height = 163.5
* Declare a variable that store a complex number
complex_no = 1 + 1j
* Write a script that prompts the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of this triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).
    Enter base: 20
    Enter height: 10
    The area of the triangle is 100
height = int(input("enter the height of the triangle :- "))
base = int(input("enter the base of the triangle :- "))
area = int((base*height)/2)
print(f"the area of the triangle given is {area}")
* Write a script that prompts the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle. Calculate the perimeter of the triangle (perimeter = a + b + c).
Enter side a: 5
Enter side b: 4
Enter side c: 3
* The perimeter of the triangle is 12

a_side = int(input("enter the length of the a side of triangle :- "))
b_side = int(input("enter the length of the b side of triangle :- "))
c_side = int(input("enter the length of the c side of triangle :- "))
perimeter_triangle = a_side + b_side + c_side
print(f"the perimeter of the triangle given is {perimeter_triangle}")
* Get length and width of a rectangle using prompt. Calculate its area (area = length x width) and perimeter (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))

a_side = int(input("enter the length of the a side of rectangle :- "))
b_side = int(input("enter the length of the b side of rectangle :- "))
perimeter = (a_side+b_side)*2
area = a_side*b_side
print(f"area of the rectangle is {area} and perimeter of the rectangle is {perimeter}")
* Get radius of a circle using prompt. Calculate the area (area = pi x r x r) and circumference (c = 2 x pi x r) where pi = 3.14.
import math
radius = int(input("enter the radius of the given circle :- "))
circumferece = math.pi*2*radius
area = math.pi*(radius**2)
print(f"the circumference of the given circle is {circumferece} and area is {area}")
* Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2
x1 = int(input("enter the value of x1 :- "))
y1 = 2*x1 - 2
x2 = int(input("enter the value of x2 :- "))
y2 = 2*x2 - 2
slope = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)
print(f"the slope the given equation will always be {int(slope)} as it is a straight line")
* Slope is (m = y2-y1/x2-x1). Find the slope and Euclidean distance between point (2, 2) and point (6,10)
import math
x1,y1,x2,y2 = (2,2,6,10)
euclidean_distance = math.sqrt((y2-y1)**2 + (x2-x1)**2)
slope = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)
print(f"the slope the given equation will always be {int(slope)} as it is a straight line and the euclidean distance is {euclidean_distance}")
* Compare the slopes in tasks 8 and 9.
they both are straight line thats why their slope will always be 2.
* Calculate the value of y (y = x^2 + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is going to be 0.
x = int(input("enter the value of x to find out y :- "))
y = x**2 + 6*x + 9
print(f"the root of the equation is {x}" if y==0 else f"try again the entered value of {x} is not the root")
* Find the length of 'python' and 'dragon' and make a falsy comparison statement.
print(len('python')!=len('jargon))
* Use and operator to check if 'on' is found in both 'python' and 'dragon'
# print('on' in 'python' and  'on' in 'jargon')
* I hope this course is not full of jargon. Use in operator to check if jargon is in the sentence.
saying = 'i hope this course is not full of jargon'
print('jargon' in saying)
* There is no 'on' in both dragon and python
print('on' not in 'python' and  'on' not in 'jargon')
print('on' not in 'python' or  'on' in 'jargon')
* Find the length of the text python and convert the value to float and convert it to string
print(str(float(len('python'))))
* Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check if a number is even or not using python?
user_input = int(input("enter the digit in your mind :- "))
print("even" if user_input % 2 == 0 else "odd")
* Check if the floor division of 7 by 3 is equal to the int converted value of 2.7
# True
print((7//3)==int(2.7))
* Check if type of '10' is equal to type of 10 #False
* Check if int('9.8') is equal to 10 #False
* Writ a script that prompts the user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person?
* Enter hours: 40
* Enter rate per hour: 28
* Your weekly earning is 1120

hours, rph = map(int,input("enter the hours you worked and the rph decided by the govt. :- ").split())
print(f"the person who worked {hours}h will earn {hours*rph}$ as per the {rph}$ per hour decided by the ruling govt.")
* Write a script that prompts the user to enter number of years. Calculate the number of seconds a person can live. Assume a person can live hundred years
Enter number of years you have lived: 100
You have lived for 3153600000 seconds.

years_onelived = int(input("enter your age in years :- "))
print(f"as per the research data a person can live on an average 100 years that why you have lived {years_onelived*60*60*24*365} seconds and {(100-years_onelived)*60*60*24*365} seconds left for rest of your life")
* Write a Python script that displays the following table
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 4 8
3 1 3 9 27
4 1 4 16 64
5 1 5 25 125

print(
"""1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 4 8
3 1 3 9 27
4 1 4 16 64
5 1 5 25 125"""
