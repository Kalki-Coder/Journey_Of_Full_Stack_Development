DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm


let now = new Date();
// 2025-12-24T16:26:18.059Z
// 2025-12-24   → Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
// T            → Separator between date and time
// 16:26:18     → Time (HH:MM:SS) in 24-hour format
// .059         → Milliseconds (59 ms)
// Z            → UTC time zone (Zulu time)

// console.log(now.toString());
// console.log(now.toUTCString());
// YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
console.log(`YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm\n${now.getFullYear()}-${now.getMonth()+1}-${now.getDate()} ${now.getHours()}:${now.getMinutes()}`)
// DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm
console.log(`DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm\n${now.getDate()}-${now.getMonth()+1}-${now.getFullYear()} ${now.getHours()}:${now.getMinutes()}`)
// DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm

Exercises: Level 3
* Create a human readable time format using the Date time object. The hour and the minute should be all the time two digits(7 hours should be 07 and 5 minutes should be 05 )
YYY-MM-DD HH:mm eg. 20120-01-02 07:05


let iso = '2025-01-24T01:38:18.059Z';
let now = new Date(iso);
let year = String(now.getFullYear()).padStart(4,'0');
let month = String(now.getMonth()+1).padStart(2,'0');
let day = String(now.getDate()).padStart(2,'0');
let hours = String(now.getHours()).padStart(2,'0');
let minutes = String(now.getMinutes()).padStart(2,'0');

// YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
console.log(`YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm\n${year}-${month}-${day} ${hours}:${minutes}`)
